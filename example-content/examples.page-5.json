  "description": "Monogenetic diseases provide a direct link between a change in protein function to cell and organ dysfunction. Studying monogenetic diseases often permits identification of cellular roles of ion channels. Moreover, disease-causing mutations usually affect important functions of the affected proteins, and analysis of the functional consequences of such mutations thus provides novel insights into the molecular determinants of protein functions.",
